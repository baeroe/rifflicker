# rifflicker

rifflicker is a react-web-app that allows the user to practice playing scales on guitar and bass. 
You have to select your instrument and the key and scale you want to play and the app displayes all tones on their position on the fredboard. 
You can activate the frequency recognition with the button on the bottom of the screen.

Be sure that you have nodejs and npm installed! 

To build and run the app locally download the repository and run the following commands in the project folder:

    npm install
    npm run start
    
good luck and have fun!
